<h1>SCRAP SMART SUSTAINABILITY</h1>

<p>In the often-overlooked realm of environmental infrastructure, numerous communities grapple with subpar waste management setups, which contribute to environmental degradation and health risks. </p>

<p>Enter our web application, that acknowledges the critical need to confront these issues head-on to curtail the adverse climate impacts. The project aims to empower users to report scrap in their areas, incentivize responsible waste disposal, and create a structured system for scrap collectors to purchase recyclable materials thereby promoting sustainaibility</p>

<p>our initiative prevents environmental degradation caused by improper waste disposal, which can lead to air and water pollution. Such pollution not only harms ecosystems but also contributes to climate change through the release of harmful chemicals and particulate matter into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>By facilitating effective waste management practices, such as recycling and proper disposal techniques, we help reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with decomposing waste. Improperly disposed waste often releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change. By streamlining waste disposal processes and encouraging recycling, our platform helps mitigate these emissions, thus contributing to climate resilience.</p>
