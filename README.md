<h1>SCRAP-SMART-SUSTAINABILITY</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The rising concern of improper waste disposal and the need for a cleaner environment motivates the development of a waste management project.</p>

<p>Enter our web application, designed to function as an online hub for individuals seeking effective waste management solutions. Whether it's routine disposal or the clearance of accumulated waste in public spaces, our platform is here to assist.The project aims to empower users to report scrap in their areas, incentivize responsible waste disposal, and create a structured system for scrap collectors to purchase recyclable materials thereby promoting sustainability.</p>

<p>our initiative prevents environmental degradation caused by improper waste disposal, which can lead to air and water pollution. Such pollution not only harms ecosystems but also contributes to climate change through the release of harmful chemicals and particulate matter into the atmosphere.</p>

<p>By facilitating effective waste management practices, such as recycling and proper disposal techniques, we help reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with decomposing waste. Improperly disposed waste often releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change. By streamlining waste disposal processes and encouraging recycling, our platform helps mitigate these emissions, thus contributing to climate resilience</p>
