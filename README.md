<h1>SCRAP SMART SUSTAINABILITY</h1>

<p>In the often-overlooked realm of environmental infrastructure, numerous communities grapple with subpar waste management setups, which contribute to environmental degradation and health risks. </p>

<p>Enter our web application, that acknowledges the critical need to confront these issues head-on to curtail the adverse climate impacts.
</p>

<p>Our initiative prevents environmental degradation caused by improper waste disposal, that not only harms biodiversity but also contributes to climate change through the release of harmful chemicals and particulate matter into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>By facilitating effective waste management practices, we help reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with decomposing waste.</p>

<p>In addition, our project also provides the services as per the user, could be a common man, municipality or a scrap collector</p>

<h2>ABOUT PROJECT</h2>
<p>The project aims to empower users to report scrap in their areas, incentivize responsible waste disposal, monitoring statistics by municipality and create a structured system for scrap collectors to purchase recyclable materials. </p>
<p>It involves a comprehensive platform with three key logins: Users, Municipality and Scrap Collectors. Users can log in to report scrap, sell recyclables and earn credits from the municipality for their contributions. Municipality can monitor statistics and incentivize responsible waste disposal. Scrap collectors can access a marketplace to purchase recyclable materials.</p>
