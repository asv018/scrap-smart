<h1>SCRAP-SMART-SUSTAINABILITY</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The rising concern of improper waste disposal and the need for a cleaner environment motivates the development of a waste management project. The project aims to empower users to report scrap in their areas, incentivize responsible waste disposal, and create a structured system for scrap collectors to purchase recyclable materials.
</p>
<p>
Consider the cycle of waste: materials discarded by human activity find their way into landfills, incinerators, and oceans, where they undergo various processes of decomposition or combustion. These processes release greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to the blanket of gases that trap heat and lead to global warming.</p>
